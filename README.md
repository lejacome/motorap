Second Screen Node JS App
============

Second Screen Experience web application with node.js and websockets

We control an HTML5 video player from multiple devices with the use of Websockets.
For Example we open the app from the desktop and then through the Google QR Code API we
control the desktop video player from our mobile device.
We can make use of all the events of the player.
